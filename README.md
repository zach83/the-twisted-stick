An adaptation of the *Spartan's Scytale* with a little twist thrown into the mix.

### The Scytale

The Spartan's Scytale is an ancient encoding system that works by writing on a slip of paper wrapped around a staff. By unwinding the writing, the text would appear scrambled! This project takes this one step further, too, by letting the user say where the text gets "wrapped" by adding in a PIN.

So, how is this beneficial in comparison to other encryption programs? The problem with them is that when the output arrives, it can be excessively long. This is when transposition really can shine in encryption. With more words added to your message, it will be even more difficult for someone to decode the message not knowing the PIN you entered.
