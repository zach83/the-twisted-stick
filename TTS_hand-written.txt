The Twisted Stick: Hand-Written


It is possible to reenact the encryption process of The Twisted Stick by hand! 
Of course, there is, first, always the option of doing the regular Spartan Scytale by wrapping paper around a staff.
However, if you need to encorporate a PIN, this is how it's done.

-------------------------------


You will start off by having the message you want to encrypt written out on a sheet of paper.
For this example, "hello world" will be used.

hello world




Next, come up with the PIN you want to use based on how long your message is.
For this example, "42" will be used.

hello world     42




Now, based on the key you have chosen, replace all spaces with a character, and divide up your message with a second character.

hell,o~,worl,d    42




Stack the sections under one another.

hell            42
o~
worl
d




If you notice, there is some space between the words when you read the text from top to bottom, left to right.
This is where you will fill in the spaces with a character not used in the message (which has been the comma (",")).

hell            42
o~,,
worl
d,,,




Write out the letters going from top to bottom, including the filler characters, and you'll have your encrypted message!

howde~o,l,r,l,l,




To decrypt your message, you will have to take a slightly different approach, since the reciever won't know what the message actually is.
In this process, write out the message, including the filler characters, based on the PIN.

howd
e~o,
l,r,
l,l,




Count how many rows show up. Number your text in order of them.

howde~o,l,r,l,l,
1234123412341234




Stack them as you have done before, one over the other.
You'll start to see your message forming back together.

hell
o~,,
worl
d,,,




Place the rows side to side and remove all of the filler characters to get your result!

hello world
